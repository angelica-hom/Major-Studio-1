# Major Studio 1 Fall 2021

This repository contains my assignments and projects for the Major Studio 1 course at Parsons School of Design's MS in Data Visualization. The course culminated into my final visualization called Worth a Thousand Words: A word analysis through racial justice lens of titles of the photography collection at the NMAAHC.
