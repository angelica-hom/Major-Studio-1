        <!-- <h1>Worth a Thousand Words</h1>
        <p>19th century American history is defined by a few important events: the Civil War, the abolitionist movement, emancipation, and Juneteenth.
        During the same century, early photography underwent rapid advances that made the technology available to recently-freed African Americans. African Americans 
        used photography as a tool for racial justice to fight against established racist misrepresentations and to take control of their own visual narrative through 
        self-representation. <br>Through the Smithsonian's Open Access initiative, this data visualization allows you to explore the titles of the photography collection at the 
        National Museum of African American History & Culture, and to discover how African American men and women used their newfound creative freedom to redefine African 
        American identity.</p>
