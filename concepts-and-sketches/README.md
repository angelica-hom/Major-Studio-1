This viz willÂ explore items related to music from the Nat'l Museum of African American History and Culture. This includes 261 items: photos, instruments, clothing/costumes, posters/tickets, and sheet music. The data set's quality is good! An accurate and varied collection over a large span of time.

How did the origins of African-American music arise from the conditions of slavery? In what ways did African-American music bring joy? What themes were explored through music? Are there patterns of African-American music by geographic area?

I chose a hybrid of timeline and pin map to explore the items throughout the music's evolution and simultaneously see patterns in the geographic spread of the influence of African-American music.

**Concept #2: In Fashion: A Timeline of African-American Clothing**

This viz will explore clothing items from the Nat'l Museum of African American History and Culture. This includes 260 items: clothes, costumes, and accessories from the 1600s - 2010s. The data set is ripe with a variety of themes including slavery, incarceration, sports, activism, entertainment and more.

Could clothing reflect the struggles and successes of African-American lives throughout history? Was clothing worn for protest, entertainment, or utility?

I chose a timeline method mixed with a gallery wall to show the evolution of fashion through a unique scrolling experience (similar to Pinterest or viewing a fashion museum in person) with color-coded keywords.

**Concept #3: Worth a Thousand Words: African-Americans' Lives Through Photographs**

This viz will explore photographs from the Nat'l Museum of African American History and Culture. This includes 595 photographs over a large span of time. The data set is larger and a good starting place to explore multiple themes. However, many of these photos are "unidentified" so it would be a challenge to know more backstory to the photos.

Could we see a rich tapestry of African-American life over the centuries through the viz? What were the occasions for the photographs? Is there a pattern of themes or occupations in the photos? Business owners, military, etc.?

I chose a bar chart along with a gallery wall with keywords for filtering to show the distribution of the museum's photographs over time.
